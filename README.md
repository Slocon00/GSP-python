## A Python implementation of Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm for sequential pattern mining

This project implements the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm to find frequent sequences within a given
dataset. This implementation includes parameters for the _mingap_, _maxgap_, and _maxspan_ time constraints.
